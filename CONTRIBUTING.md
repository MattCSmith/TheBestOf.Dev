### 👉 Sumbitting a fix / Correcting Typos

If you ever noticed a bug or anything worth fixing, please feel free to open a PR to address the issue. Please ensure to provide as much information in the PR description as possible.

Otherwise please open an issue with enough details of the bug, steps to replicate it and screenshots if possible.

### 👉 Updating or improving and existing `Entry`

If you have new information or an `Entry` is out of date, please feel free to either create a PR yourself or and issue so someone else can make the changes.

In either case please make sure to:

In either case please make sure to:

- Ensure the `Entry` is of good quality. Ensuring Accuracy
- Provide as much information in the issue/pr description, using screenshots where useful

### 👉 **Suggesting** a new `Collection` and/or `Topic`

Please open an issue. Let's have a conversation around:

- The naming convention
- If its really required or can be merged with another Collection/Topic
- If there is a better way to implement it
- What Topics and/or Entries might be contained within

We should carefully consider each new `Collection` and `Topic` to maintain a balanced structure, that is easy to navigate.

## Collection SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS / INFO / FAQ

This section aims to provide more insight into specific requirements for a given Collection/Topic

### How should I categorise a Youtube channel in the `Development-Youtubers` Collection?

> Quite often a Youtube channel will cover multiple topics, so its hard to classify just one Collection it belongs too. You may add the channel to every `Topic` the channel substaintially covers within its videos.
>
> For example: Channel A mainly talks about Javascript and vlogs alot. They also released one video on game development.
> This channel belongs in `javascript-youtubers.md` and `dev-vloggers.md` but NOT in the `game-dev-youtubers.md` topic.
>
> Why? Think about the viewer, is someone who is focused on Game Dev going to be interested in a channel with just one game dev video?
>
> Let's keep the `Topics` lean and clean.
