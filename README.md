# TheBestOf.Dev

Discovering the power of visual learning, I started curating an extensive list of programming YouTubers in [this blog post](https://mattcsmith.dev/content/the-ultimate-list-of-developer-youtube-channels) in Jan 2022. However I believe the true strength lies in the collective contributions to refine, update, and expand upon this foundation.

I'd also love to expand upon this concept to curate more than just the best Youtube Channels. Think `Podcasts`, `Courses and Learning Platforms`, `Cheatsheets`, `Articles & Resources`, `Job Hunting Tools`, `Newsletters`.

I'd like to invite you to join in this collaborative effort. Share this compilation with fellow learners, contribute your favorite channels/resources , and offer insights to improve the overall quality. Together, let's build a dynamic hub that empowers individuals on their learning journey and fosters a vibrant community of knowledge sharing.

Your input is not just welcomed but essential to the evolution of this project. Checkout the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for important information on contributing to this project. Let's shape the future of programming education together.
