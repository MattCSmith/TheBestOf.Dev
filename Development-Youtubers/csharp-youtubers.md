> My goal is to make your life easier, specifically when it comes to learning software development. I remember what it was like to not know even what questions to ask. In every video I do, I try to answer those questions. You will notice that I don't usually do quick videos. That's because I would rather help you understand rather than just padding my watch percentages. If you want more in-depth training, feel free to head over to my website where I have courses dedicated to C#, SQL, and more.
